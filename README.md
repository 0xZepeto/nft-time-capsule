# NFT Time Capsule - Proof of Concept

## Overview

## Next Steps
- Implement minimal smart contract on testnet.
- Connect simple frontend for minting and revealing.
- Explore integration with Soundness proof layer for secure reveal.


# NFT Time Capsule - PoC

This is a simple **Proof of Concept** for the NFT Time Capsule idea.  
Users can "mint" an NFT, wait for a countdown, and then unlock hidden content.

## How it Works
1. Click **Mint NFT** → sets unlock time (10s).
2. Wait for countdown.
3. Click **Check Unlock** → content is revealed.
